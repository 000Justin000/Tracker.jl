# Flux

Flux is a library for machine learning, implemented in Julia. Flux lets you use the full power of the Julia language while providing a set of useful helper functionality, like common mathematical functions and optimisers.

# Installation

Install [Julia 0.6.0 or later](https://julialang.org/downloads/), if you haven't already.

```julia
Pkg.add("Flux")
Pkg.test("Flux") # Check things installed correctly
```

Start with the [basics](basics.html). The [model zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/) is also a good starting point for many common kinds of models.
