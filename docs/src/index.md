# Flux

## Charging Ion Capacitors

Flux is a high-level API for machine learning, implemented in Julia.

Flux aims to provide a concise and expressive syntax for architectures that are hard to express within other frameworks. The notation should be familiar and extremely close to what you'd find in a paper or description of the model.

The current focus is on ANNs with TensorFlow or MXNet as a backend.
